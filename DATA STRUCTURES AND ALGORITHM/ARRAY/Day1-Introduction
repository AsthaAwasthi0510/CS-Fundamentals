WHAT IS ARRAY?

-A linear arrangement of data of the same type of elements
-An array has to be declared first with the maximum number of elements it can store
SYNTAX: datatype array_name[size];
example: int marks[100]; // marks array of integer datatype of size 100
         char name[20]; // name array of character datatype of size 20


HOW IS AN ARRAY STORED?

Starting from a given memory location, the successive array elements are allocated space in consecutive memory locations.
x: starting address of the array in memory
k: number of bytes allocated per array element
a[i] is allocated memory location at address x+i*k
